# ECAD 3D Model Generator

This project provides tools to generate 3D electronic component
models. Components are defined with their basic dimensions and
exported to file formats such as STEP, VRML, X3D even FreeCAD.

Scripts are implemented with Python. We use
[cadquery](https://github.com/dcowden/cadquery) and
[FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org/) APIs for modeling and exporting.

## Currently Included Generators

## Where are the model files?

Model files are uploaded to a separate repository to keep this git
repository small in size. You can find models in different formats here:
